    /*
    "YAGNI" stands for "You Aren't Gonna Need It".
    It is a principle in software development that suggests developers should only implement features that are
    necessary for the current requirements and not add any additional functionality that might be needed in the future.
    This principle is based on the idea that adding unnecessary features can lead to increased complexity, longer
    development times, and potentially more bugs.

    Feature Creep avoided: A development team is working on a web application. They initially plan to include a
    feature that allows users to create and share custom avatars. However, after considering the time and resources required to implement this feature, they decide to postpone it until they receive feedback from users indicating that it is necessary.
